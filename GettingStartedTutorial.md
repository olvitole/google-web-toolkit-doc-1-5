# GWT Tutorial #

This tutorial introduces the fundamentals of a Google Web Toolkit (GWT) application by walking you through the creation of a simple stock watch list that we'll call "StockWatcher".  As we build the application, you'll learn about each of the major features of GWT, including the widget library, hosted mode debugging, remote procedure calls, internationalization, and lots more.
