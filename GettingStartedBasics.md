# The Basics #

We'll start by covering the basics of GWT development, creating a project from scratch and then incrementally adding features until we have a fully-functional application ready to be deployed to a web server.

After completing these topics, you can continue to the [Add More Features](GettingStartedMore.md) learn about topics like [remote procedure calls](GettingStartedRPC.md) and [internationalization](GettingStartedI18n.md).
