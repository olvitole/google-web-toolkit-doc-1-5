# Can I use GWT with my favorite server-side templating tool? #

Yes, you are free to use GWT with any server-side templating tool such as XSLT, Frontpage, Dreamweaver, WebObjects, PHP, Active Server Pages, or JavaServer Pages to name a few.

With GWT development, your Java client code gets compiled into equivalent JavaScript that is loaded into your host pages. The generated product is totally independent from the server-side technology that you choose to use in your web application.

You can go ahead and use your favorite server-side templating tool and include your template directives into your host pages along with your GWT-generated JavaScript files. The server-side technology you're using to realize the templates is invisible to the browser and works just as it does without your GWT modules.
