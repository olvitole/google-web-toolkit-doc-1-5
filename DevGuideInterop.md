# Interoperability #

Often, you will need to integrate GWT with existing handwritten JavaScript or with a third-party JavaScript library.  Occasionally you may need to access low-level browser functionality not exposed by the GWT class API's.  The [JavaScript Native Interface (JSNI)](DevGuideJavaScriptNativeInterface.md) feature of GWT can solve both of these problems by allowing you to integrate JavaScript directly into your application's Java source code.

## Specifics ##
