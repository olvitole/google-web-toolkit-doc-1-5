# Does GWT support standards mode? #
As of GWT 1.5, yes. Standards mode is supported. For backwards compatibility, quirks mode is also still supported. Support for quirks mode, however, may be dropped in future versions of GWT, and it is recommended that you update your GWT-enabled pages to use standards mode.

Prior to GWT 1.4, no. Only quirks mode is completely supported by GWT. Your mileage may vary in standards mode, but it can usually be made to work with a little fiddling. See the [known incompatibilities](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/list?can=2&q=category:DocType) for details.
