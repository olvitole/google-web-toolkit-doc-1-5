# Developer Guide #

The GWT Developer Guide contains a variety of topics that explain the various components of the toolkit and techniques for using them when building applications.

## Topic Guide ##

[Fundamentals](DevGuideFundamentals.md)
Core GWT concepts such as [compiling Java source into JavaScript](DevGuideJavaToJavaScriptCompiler.md) and [cross-browser support](DevGuideCrossBrowserSupport.md).

[Project Structure](DevGuideProjectStructure.md)
Describes the files and structure of a GWT project.

[Building User Interfaces](DevGuideUserInterface.md)
As shown in [the gallery](DevGuideWidgetGallery.md), GWT includes a variety of [widgets and panels](DevGuideWidgetsAndPanels.md) that serve as cross-browser building blocks for your application. GWT also includes unique and powerful optimization facilities such as [image bundles](DevGuideImageBundles.md).

[Debugging in Hosted Mode](DevGuideHostedMode.md)
An embedded web browser lets you run and debug applications directly in any Java development environment before being translated into JavaScript.

[Running in Web Mode](DevGuideRunningInWebMode.md)
The Hosted Mode shell allows you to run the GWT compiler to generate JavaScript and view your application in a web browser.

[Deployment in Web Mode](DevGuideWebMode.md)
Compile your application into JavaScript for easy deployment.

[Communicating with a server](DevGuideServerCalls.md)
Make calls to backend servers using [GWT RPC](DevGuideRemoteProcedureCalls.md) or [direct HTTP](DevGuideHttpRequests.md).

[Unit Testing](DevGuideJUnitIntegration.md)
Integration with JUnit lets you test your AJAX code almost as easily as any other Java code.

[Accessibility](DevGuideAccessibility.md)
Making your GWT applications accessible for users with screen readers.

[Internationalization](DevGuideInternationalization.md)
Easily support multiple locales with a single code base.

[Interoperability](DevGuideInterop.md)
Integrate your GWT applications with handwritten or third-party JavaScript using [JavaScript Native Interface (JSNI)](DevGuideJavaScriptNativeInterface.md)

[Deferred Binding](DevGuideDeferredBinding.md)
Deferred binding reduces generated code size and improves run time performance.
