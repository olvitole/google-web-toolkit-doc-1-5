# Where should I submit suggestions to improve GWT? #

If you have an idea for an enhancement to GWT, please search through the [Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/list).  If it isn't there, you might want to first suggest it to the  [Google Web Toolkit developer discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit).

You can submit requests for enhancements at the [Google Web Toolkit Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/list).
When you save your report, it will be labeled as a "Defect" even though you want to submit an RFE (Request for Enhancement). Don't worry! We review each item submitted to our Issue Tracker, and will mark enhancement requests appropriately when we receive them.
