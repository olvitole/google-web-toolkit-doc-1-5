# Why translate Java code to JavaScript? #

Java technologies offer a productive development plaform, and with GWT, they can instantly become the basis of your AJAX development platform as well. Here are some of the benefits of developing with GWT:

  * You can use all of your favorite Java development tools ([Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [JProfiler](http://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html), [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/)) for AJAX development.
  * Static type checking in the Java language boosts productivity while reducing errors.
  * Common JavaScript errors (typos, type mismatches) are easily caught at compile time rather than by users at runtime.
  * Code prompting/completion is widely available.
  * Automated Java refactoring is pretty snazzy these days.
  * Java-based OO designs are easier to communicate and understand, thus making your AJAX code base more comprehensible with less documentation.
