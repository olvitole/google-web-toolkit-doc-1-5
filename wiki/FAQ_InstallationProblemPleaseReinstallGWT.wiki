#summary RuntimeException: Installation problem detected, please reinstall GWT

= !RuntimeException: Installation problem detected, please reinstall GWT =

When launching the GWT compiler or hosted mode, you may see the following exception:

{{{

This message occurs when the runtime binary installation of GWT cannot be located.  In general, the runtime binary installation path is expected to be in the same directory where `gwt-dev-<platform>.jar` is located.

The GWT installation path is embedded in the scripts that are created from [DevGuideApplicationCreator applicationCreator] and [DevGuideProjectCreator projectCreator] as the path specified to `gwt-dev-<platform>.jar`.  If you look in this directory, it should contain not only `gwt-user.jar` and `gwt-dev-<platform>.jar`, but also the platform specific shared library files, such as `libgwt_ll.so` or `libgwt_ll.jnilib`.  Make sure that the path specified to `gwt-dev-<platform>.jar` on the Java classpath still contains the shared libraries.  If not, you may need to re-download and unpack the GWT distribution, making sure your download is complete.

If you are a contributor and checked out the source code via svn, you may be running GWT from source.  Make sure you also have a binary distribution unpacked or a compiled distribution ready and have set the system property `gwt.devjar` configured in your launch configurations as specified in the file `eclipse/README.txt`.
