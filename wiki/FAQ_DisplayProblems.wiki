= Undefined DISPLAY errors compiling/testing in a console or headless environment =

On a UNIX environment, GWT tests, and in some cases the GWT compiler also, require an X display. If the continuous build is being run from a cron job, the running process may not have access to a "real" display.  You can use a program named `Xvfb` to provide a virtual display. (Xvfb stands for X11 Virtual !FrameBuffer.)

To use this, you will need to:

  # Install `Xvfb`. 
  # Start the `Xvfb` server and set the environment variable `DISPLAY` to use it:

{{{
export DISPLAY=:2

# Run Xvfb (no access control on :2) for GWT compiles and tests, if not already started.
ps -ef | grep Xvfb | grep -v grep >> /dev/null || Xvfb :2 -ac &
