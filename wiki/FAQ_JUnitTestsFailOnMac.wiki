#summary Some JUnit tests fail on the Mac platform

= Some JUnit tests fail on the Mac platform =

The Safari/Webkit web browser optimizing some rendering operations when the browser runs in headless mode.  This means that the position or size of some elements may be different when running a unit test than when running an actual application.  A common symptom is to see the position or size of an widget set to _(0,0)_.

To work around this problem, you can pass the `-notHeadless` argument in the `-Dgwt.args=` system property setting when running unit tests.  When using the ant build, this argument is enabled by default as of the GWT 1.5 release.

When `-notHeadless` is specified for running unit tests, the log window and hosted mode browser will pop up on the screen while the test is running.  Dismissing or manipulating the elements in these windows may cause the unit tests to fail.
