# How do I get my project to run again after upgrading GWT? #

If you are working on a project, you may notice problems compiling and running
your project if you upgrade the GWT library from one version to another.  Sometimes you may see GWT compiler internal errors, or you may see odd runtime errors you've never seen before.

Before you file a bug, try stopping hosted mode and erasing your compiler output (usually in the directory `www/`_<package name>_.  Then, restart hosted mode. If you're still having problems, though, we definitely want to hear about it!
