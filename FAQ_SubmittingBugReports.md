# Where should I report bugs? #

You can file a bug in the [Google Web Toolkit Issue Tracker](http://code.google.com/p/google-web-toolkit/issues/list). Please be sure to search for your problem before reporting a new issue, since someone else might have already reported it. If you would like to be notified about activities on your issue, star the report and you will receive emails at your account's email address.
