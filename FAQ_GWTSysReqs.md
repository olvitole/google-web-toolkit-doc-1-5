Google Web Toolkit is designed to run on systems that meet the following requirements:
  * Java: Sun Java 2 Runtime Environment 1.5
  * Operating system: Windows Vista/XP/2000, Mac OS X 10.4+ (Tiger or Leopard), or Linux with GTK+ 2.2.1+
  * Hardware: ~100MB of free disk space, 512MB RAM

If you have trouble running GWT, and your system meets the requirements above, let us know on the [GWT developer discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/Google-Web-Toolkit).
